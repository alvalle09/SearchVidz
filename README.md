Following tutorial on eduonix, JQuery, JS, HTML, CSS

This app makes a youtube api call, and displays results in it's own window.

For the record, following the code in this tutorial is probably the reason Angular, Vue, and React were created. I've done some 
Angular & REact tutorials and going back to using JS & jquery to format output is a little frustrating.
